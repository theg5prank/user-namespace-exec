.Nm
registers its send right for its bootstrap server with
.Xr user-namespace-execd 8 ,
for the session type
.Ar session_name
(e.g., "Background").
.Pp
Users should not normally invoke
.Nm
manually. However, it is possible to manually update the daemon's mapping for a particular
(
.Ar uid ,
.Ar session_name
) pair by running the command in that session and specifying the appropriate
session name. Note that
.Xr user-namespace-execd 8
and
.Xr user-namespace-exec-agent 8
make no attempt to validate that the send right being registered is actually for the specified
session. Abusing this may lead to
.Xr user-namespace-exec 1
receiving dead names from
.Xr user-namespace-execd 8 .
.Pp
The uid of the registration, however, is taken from the real user ID of user-namespace-exec-agent
and cannot be forged.
